abstract = {A method for measuring and mapping displacement fields and strain fields from high-resolution electron microscope (HREM) images has been developed. The method is based upon centring a small aperture around a strong reflection in the Fourier transform of an HREM lattice image and performing an inverse Fourier transform. The phase component of the resulting complex image is shown to give information about local displacements of atomic planes and the two-dimensional displacement field can be derived by applying the method to two non-colinear Fourier components. Local strain components can be found by analysing the derivative of the displacement field. The details of the technique are outlined and applied to an experimental HREM image of a domain wall in ferroelectric-ferroelastic PbTiO3.},

@article{Rouviere2005,
abstract = {The Geometrical phase analysis, which is a very efficient method to measure deformation from High resolution transmission electron microscopy images, is studied from a theoretical point of view. We point out that the basic property of this method is its ability to measure local reciprocal lattice parameters with a high level of accuracy. We attempt to provide some insights into (a) different formula used in the geometrical phase analysis such as the well-known relation between phase and displacement: Pg(r) = -2$\pi$g.u(r), (b) the two different definitions of strain, each of which corresponding to a different lattice reference and (c) the meaning of a continuous displacement in a dot-like high resolution image. The case of one-dimensional analysis is also presented. Finally, we show that the method is able to give the position of the dot that is nearest to a given pixel in the image. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Pofelski2018,
abstract = {A strain characterization technique based on Moir{\'{e}} interferometry in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and geometrical phase analysis (GPA) method is demonstrated. The deformation field is first captured in a single STEM Moir{\'{e}} hologram composed of multiple sets of periodic fringes (Moir{\'{e}} patterns) generated from the interference between the periodic scanning grating, fixing the positions of the electron probe on the sample, and the crystal structure. Applying basic principles from sampling the- ory, the Moir{\'{e}} patterns arrangement is then simulated using a STEM electron micrograph reference to convert the experimental STEM Moir{\'{e}} hologram into information related to the crystal lattice periodic- ities. The GPA method is finally applied to extract the 2D relative strain and rotation fields. The STEM Moir{\'{e}} interferometry enables the local information to be de-magnified to a large length scale, compara- ble to what can be achieved in dark-field electron holography. The STEM Moir{\'{e}} GPA method thus extends the conventional high-resolution STEM GPA capabilities by providing comparable quantitative 2D strain mapping with a larger field of view (up to a few microns)},
