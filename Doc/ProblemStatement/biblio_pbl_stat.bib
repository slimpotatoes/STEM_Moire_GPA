abstract = {A method for measuring and mapping displacement fields and strain fields from high-resolution electron microscope (HREM) images has been developed. The method is based upon centring a small aperture around a strong reflection in the Fourier transform of an HREM lattice image and performing an inverse Fourier transform. The phase component of the resulting complex image is shown to give information about local displacements of atomic planes and the two-dimensional displacement field can be derived by applying the method to two non-colinear Fourier components. Local strain components can be found by analysing the derivative of the displacement field. The details of the technique are outlined and applied to an experimental HREM image of a domain wall in ferroelectric-ferroelastic PbTiO3.},

@article{Hytch2008,
abstract = {Strained silicon is now an integral feature of the latest generation of transistors and electronic devices because of the associated enhancement in carrier mobility. Strain is also expected to have an important role in future devices based on nanowires and in optoelectronic components. Different strategies have been used to engineer strain in devices, leading to complex strain distributions in two and three dimensions. Developing methods of strain measurement at the nanoscale has therefore been an important objective in recent years but has proved elusive in practice: none of the existing techniques combines the necessary spatial resolution, precision and field of view. For example, Raman spectroscopy or X-ray diffraction techniques can map strain at the micrometre scale, whereas transmission electron microscopy allows strain measurement at the nanometre scale but only over small sample areas. Here we present a technique capable of bridging this gap and measuring strain to high precision, with nanometre spatial resolution and for micrometre fields of view. Our method combines the advantages of moir{\'{e}} techniques with the flexibility of off-axis electron holography and is also applicable to relatively thick samples, thus reducing the influence of thin-film relaxation effects.},

@article{Rouviere2013,
abstract = {NanoBeam Electron Diffraction is a simple and efficient technique to measure strain in nanostructures. Here, we show that improved results can be obtained by precessing the electron beam while maintaining a few nanometer probe size, i.e., by doing Nanobeam Precession Electron Diffraction (N-PED). The precession of the beam makes the diffraction spots more uniform and numerous, making N-PED more robust and precise. In N-PED, smaller probe size and better precision are achieved by having diffraction disks instead of diffraction dots. Precision in the strain measurement better than 2 × 10−4 is obtained with a probe size approaching 1 nm in diameter.},

abstract = {Using a highly coherent focused electron probe in a fifth-order aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope, we report on resolving a crystal spacing less than 50 pm. Based on the geometrical source size and residual coherent and incoherent axial lens aberrations, an electron probe is calculated, which is theoretically capable of resolving an ideal 47 pm spacing with 29{\%} contrast. Our experimental data show the 47 pm spacing of a Ge {\textless} 114 {\textgreater} crystal imaged with 11{\%}-18{\%} contrast at a 60{\%}-95{\%} confidence level, providing the first direct evidence for sub-50-pm resolution in annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging.},
